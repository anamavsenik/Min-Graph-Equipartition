## Min-Graph Equipartition Problem with Simulated Annealing
Consider the Graph Equipartition Problem: split the graph into two parts of almost the same size
with the smallest number of edges between the two parts. Solve it using a greedy method, and
then solve it using the simulated annealing heuristic. Compare your solutions. Experiment with
various neighbourhoods and temperatures, dense graphs, sparse graphs, random graphs.
Some comments:
1. See section 12.3.2 and example 2.7 from the book [1].
2. For details on simulated annealing, see Wikipedia, the survey [2], and the book [3]. For advanced
study, an interested reader can read more in [4,5,6].
